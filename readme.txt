--- Frisco ---
A clean and simple child theme for BuddyPress 1.5+. Frisco uses the BuddyPress default theme as its parent theme. BuddyPress must be active for Frisco to function. Frisco is currently being developed and should be added to the WordPress themes repository shortly after BuddyPress 1.5 is released. 

For help with Frisco, or for more information, please visit the BuddyPress forums, go to http://friscotheme.com/ or go to https://github.com/davidtcarson/frisco.
