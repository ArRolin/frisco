--- Frisco ---
A clean and simple child theme for BuddyPress 1.5+. Frisco uses the BuddyPress default theme as its parent theme. BuddyPress must be active for Frisco to function. Frisco is currently being developed and should be added to the WordPress themes repository shortly after BuddyPress 1.5 is released. 

For help with Frisco, or for more information, please visit the BuddyPress forums, go to http://friscotheme.com/ or go to https://github.com/davidtcarson/frisco.

There is no demo site yet, but I have made some screenshots. See https://s3.amazonaws.com/frisco/screenshot-1.png, https://s3.amazonaws.com/frisco/screenshot-2.png, https://s3.amazonaws.com/frisco/screenshot-3.png, and https://s3.amazonaws.com/frisco/screenshot-4.png

--- Installation ---
Upload and activate the Frisco theme under "Appearance > Themes" menu in your WordPress admin area.

--- Getting Started with Frisco ---
Go to "Appearance > Theme Options" to configure basic color and font options. Create a custom.css file in the root directory of the theme and enable the custom stylesheet in Theme Options to override default styles.  

*USE THE NEW ADMIN BAR IN BUDDYPRESS*
There's a new admin bar coming to BuddyPress 1.5. To use that new admin bar on your development site, add the following line to your wp-config.php file in your root directory: 

define('BP_USE_WP_ADMIN_BAR', true);
